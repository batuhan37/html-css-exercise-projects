        <h1>The World’s Healthiest Foods Are Missing From Your Diet</h1>
        <h3>When was the last time you ate barley, millet, or buckwheat?
        </h3>

      <P>  The study’s design was simple: Every day for four weeks, people ate a serving of either whole grain barley, whole grain brown rice, or both. They changed nothing else about their diets or lifestyle.</P>

      <P>At the end of those four weeks, fecal samples revealed that the people’s microbiomes had undergone healthy changes; bacterial diversity had improved, and populations of several beneficial gut microorganisms had expanded. Meanwhile, blood samples showed a reduction in some biomarkers of inflammation, as well as evidence of heathier glucose and insulin responses.</P>


      “We showed that whole grains have a significant effect on the composition of the fecal microbiota that coincided with metabolic and immunological improvements,” the study authors wrote in the paper detailing their findings.

      <P>That study, published in 2012, was one of the first to show that whole grain foods may promote healthy microbiome shifts. But it’s just one in a long line of research efforts that have tied whole grain foods to health benefits — which is why pretty much very major public health organization in the world recommends that people eat more of these foods.</P>

      <P>“There is a lot of strong research to support the recommendations to increase whole grain consumption,” says Janne Martikainen, PhD, a professor of health economics at the University of Eastern Finland. “The benefits have been seen in decreasing disease risk — especially for Type 2 diabetes — and also in reduced mortality.”</P>

      <P>In a study published last month in the journal Nutrients, Martikainen and colleagues estimated that Finland could potentially save close to $1 billion in diabetes-related health care costs during the next 10 years if every person in that country ate just one additional daily serving of whole grains. (This is in a country of five million people, where the diabetes rate in adults is roughly 9%. In the U.S., 13% of the country’s 260 million adults has diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation.)</P>

      <P>Whole grains aren’t sexy. They aren’t exotic. And yet over and over again, both observational and intervention studies have found that whole grains are arguably the healthiest foods human beings consume.
    </P>

    <p>
        Earlier this year, a comprehensive research review on whole grain foods concluded that people who eat them are at reduced risk for Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and several different types of cancer.

    <p>
        The review laid out all the ways that whole grains foods may support human health.
    </p>
    
    <p>For one thing, they contain numerous essential vitamins and minerals — including a handful that are almost wholly absent in other foodstuffs. They’re also excellent sources of both soluble and insoluble fiber, which are indigestible carbohydrates that feed healthy gut bacteria and keep the GI tract from becoming clogged with partially digested food particles.
